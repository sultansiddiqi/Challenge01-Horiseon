## Project Description
Assignment Instructions:
For this week's Challenge, your task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO. It's important to follow the Scout Rule when working with an existing codebase: Always leave the code a little cleaner than you found it. 

To impress the imaginary client for this Challenge, you should go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long-term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, such as by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Remember when working with a client, it is essential to read the acceptance criteria for guidance and clarity on what the client expects, especially when asked to make a judgment call, such as when an icon needs an accessible alt tag and when it is okay to leave it blank. 

## Overview of Refactor 
* Editing the title tag to reflect the correct company name
* Fixed missing id pointer to correctly allow anchors on the page to work
* Removed many DIV elements to include HTML Elements including: Body, Header, Nav, Section, Footer
* Adjusting header tags to go into descending order to follow 
* Added comments to show which adjustments were made
* CSS Page: Grouping classes that had the same paramters into one section
    - This was done by cleaning up the classes as well as creating new ones to apply to similar areas.

### Acceptance Criteria
